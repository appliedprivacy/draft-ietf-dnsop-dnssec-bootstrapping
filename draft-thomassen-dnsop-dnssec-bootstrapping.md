.# Abstract

This document describes an authenticated in-band method for automatic
signaling of a Child DNS zone's delegation signer information from the zone's DNS
operator(s).  The zone's registrar or registry may subsequently use this
signal for automatic DS record provisioning in the parent zone.
The protocol is particularly useful in case of managed DNS providers
hosting registrant's domains, where DS provisioning has so far been
cumbersome.

The signaling channel is not specific to the DS bootstrapping use
case, but equally suitable for announcing other zone-specific
information from the DNS Operator in an authenticated fashion.
Further potential applications thus include, for example, key
exchange between parties in an [@!RFC8901] multisigner setup.

# Introduction

**TODO remove**: this section is inspired by [@!RFC7344], Section 1.

The first time a Child DNS Operator signs a zone, they need to communicate
the keying material to the Parent.  Depending on the desires of the
Parent, the Child might send their DNSKEY record, a DS record, or
both.

So far, out-of-band methods are typically used to complete the chain
of trust.  In-band methods exist, in particular based on the CDS and
CDNSKEY record types as specified in [@!RFC7344] and [@!RFC8078].
However, such communication is only authenticated when performing a
rollover of the Child's keys represented in the parent.  An
authenticated in-band channel for enabling DNSSEC so far has been
missing.

How the keying material is conveyed to the Parent during initial DNSSEC
bootstrapping depends on the relationship the Child has with the Parent.
The communication has to occur between the Child DNS Operator and, depending
on the circumstances, the Registry or the Registrar, possibly via the
Registrant (for details, see [@!RFC7344], Appendix A).  In many cases,
this is a manual process -- and not an easy one.  Any manual
process is susceptible to mistakes and/or errors.  In addition, due to
the annoyance factor of the process, involved parties may avoid the
process of getting a DS record set published at the Parent.

DNSSEC provides data integrity to information published in DNS; thus,
DNS publication can be used to automate maintenance of delegation
information.  This document describes a method to automate
publication of initial DS records for a hitherto insecure delegation.

Readers are expected to be familiar with DNSSEC, including [@!RFC4033],
[@!RFC4034], [@!RFC4035], [@!RFC6781], [@!RFC7344], and [@!RFC8078].


## Terminology

The terminology we use is defined in this section.  The highlighted
roles are as follows:

Child
: The entity on record that has the delegation of the domain
  from the Parent.

Parent
: The zone that contains the Child's delegation records.

Child DNS Operator
: The entity that maintains and publishes the zone information
  for the Child DNS.

Parental Agent
: The entity that the Child has a relationship with to change
  its delegation information.

Signaling Domain(s)
: For any given authoritative nameserver hostname from the Child's
  NS record set, the hostname prefixed with the label `_boot` is one
  of the Signaling Domains for the Child Zone.

Signaling Zone
: The zone which is authoritative for a given Signaling Domain.

Signaling Name
: A name under a Signaling Domain that can be mapped onto the
  Child zone's name.

Signaling Record
: A DNS record located at a Signaling Name under a Signaling Domain.
  Signaling Records are used by the Child DNS Operator to publish
  information about the Child.

CDS/CDNSKEY
: This notation refers to CDS and/or CDNSKEY, i.e., one or both.

Base32hex Encoding
: "Base 32 Encoding with Extended Hex Alphabet" as per [@!RFC4648].


## Requirements Notation

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**",
"**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**",
"**RECOMMENDED**", "**NOT RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and
"**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
BCP 14 [@!RFC2119] [@!RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
capitals, as shown here.

{#signaling}
# Signaling

When setting up initial trust, the child generally wants to enable
global validation.
As long as the child is insecure, DNS answers can be forged.  The goal
is to promote the child from insecure to secure as soon as reasonably
possible by the parent.  This means that the period from the child's
publication of CDS/CDNSKEY RRset to the parent publishing the
synchronized DS RRset should be as short as possible.

This goal is achieved by transferring trust from the Child DNS
Operator by publishing an authenticated signal that can be discovered
and processed by the Parent.  Implementation by Child DNS Operators
and Parental Agents is RECOMMENDED.

## Preconditions

If a Child DNS Operator implements the protocol, the following conditions
have to be met:

1. Each Signaling Zone MUST be securely delegated, i.e.
   have a valid DNSSEC chain of trust from the root.

2. The Child DNS Operator MUST publish CDS/CDNSKEY records at the
   Child's apex, as described in [@!RFC7344].

[ In the course of the bootstrapping protocol, the Parental Agent
will fetch the CDS/CDNSKEY records from another source.  The second
condition ensures that the Parental Agent can validate these records
against the customary CDS/CDNSKEY records from the Child.
The bootstrapping protocol is thus an extension of the existing
CDS/CDNSKEY protocol, and therefore provides strictly stronger
guarantees than the traditional model. ]

[ Requiring presence of CDS/CDNSKEY records in the Child also
faciliates simple opt-out by the zone administrator, protects against
synchronization errors, and allows failing-close in case of a hash
collision (see (#signalingnames)). ]

### Example

When performing DNSSEC bootstrapping for the Child zone
`example.co.uk` using NS records `ns1.example.net` and
`ns2.example.net`, the Child DNS Operator

1. needs to ensure that a valid DNSSEC chain of trust exists for the
   zone(s) that are authoritative for the Signaling Domains
   `_boot.ns1.example.net` and `_boot.ns2.example.net`;

2. publishes CDS/CDNSKEY records at `example.co.uk`.


{#signalingnames}
## Signaling Names

To publish a piece of information about the Child zone in an
authenticated fashion, the Child DNS Operator MUST publish one or
more Signaling Records at the Child's Signaling Name under each
Signaling Domain.

Signaling Records MUST be accompanied by RRSIG records created with
the corresponding Signaling Zone's key(s).  The type and contents
of these Signaling Records depend on the specific use case as
described below.

The Signaling Name MUST consist of the following two labels:

1. the first label of the Child name;

2. a label equal to the SHA-256 hash digest of the fully qualified
   domain name of the Child's immediate ancestor in the DNS tree (one
   level up), using wire format for the hash input and "Base 32
   Encoding with Extended Hex Alphabet" as specified in [@!RFC4648]
   for the output.  Trailing padding characters ("=") MUST be dropped.

Note that the "fully qualified domain name of the Child's immediate
ancestor in the DNS tree" coincides with the Parent's FQDN only when
the delegation is directly (one level) under the Parent's apex.
For deeper delegations, it also contains the labels between the
Parent and the Child.

[ The purpose of the hash function is to avoid the possibility of
exceeding the maximum length of a DNS name, and to normalize the
number of labels in a Signaling Name.
The encoding choice is like in NSEC3, except that SHA-256 is used
instead of SHA-1.  This is to make it harder for other tenants in
shared hosting environments to create hash collisions. ]

[ Prefixing the first label verbatim minimizes the number of hash
calculations that need to be performed by the Child DNS Operator and
the Parental Agent, and also facilitates discovery of unprocessed
Signaling Records by the Parental Agent by means of NSEC walking the
Signaling Domain. (If the first label was part of the hash, the
Parental Agent would not be able to infer the Child's name.) ]

[ **Example code** (Python, with `dnspython` package):
```
from base64 import b32encode
from hashlib import sha256

import dns.name
from dns.rdtypes.ANY.NSEC3 import b32_normal_to_hex

child = 'example.co.uk.'
prefix, suffix = child.split('.', 1)
suffix_wire_format = dns.name.from_text(suffix).to_wire()
suffix_digest = sha256(suffix_wire_format).digest()
suffix_digest = b32encode(suffix_digest).translate(b32_normal_to_hex).rstrip(b'=')
signaling_name = prefix + '.' + suffix_digest.lower().decode()
print(signaling_name)
# >>> 'example.bge2bvlnqt4ei2oq3v9nr8a0lh9nkf6b4lh6c3j51k5kd67helmg'
```
]

# Bootstrapping a DNSSEC Delegation

{#signalingrecords}
## Signaling Intent to Act as the Child's Signer

To announce its willingness to act as the Child's delegated signer,
the Child DNS operator co-publishes the Child's CDS/CDNSKEY records
at the corresponding Signaling Name under each Signaling Domain as
defined in (#signalingnames).

Previous use of CDS/CDNSKEY records is specified at the apex only
([@!RFC7344], Section 4.1).  This protocol extends the use of these
record types at non-apex owner names for the purpose of DNSSEC
bootstrapping.  To exclude the possibility of semantic collision,
there MUST NOT be a zone cut at a Signaling Name.

Unlike the CDS/CDNSKEY records at the Child's apex, Signaling
Records MUST be signed with the corresponding Signaling Zone's
key(s).  Their contents MUST be identical to the corresponding
records published at the Child's apex.

### Example

For the purposes of bootstrapping the Child zone `example.co.uk` with
NS records `ns1.example.net` and `ns2.example.net`, the required
Signaling Domains are `_boot.ns1.example.net` and
`_boot.ns2.example.net`.

In the zones containing these domains, the Child DNS Operator
publishes the Child's CDS/CDNSKEY records at the names
```
example.bge2bvlnqt4ei2oq3v9nr8a0lh9nkf6b4lh6c3j51k5kd67helmg._boot.ns1.example.net
example.bge2bvlnqt4ei2oq3v9nr8a0lh9nkf6b4lh6c3j51k5kd67helmg._boot.ns2.example.net
```
where `example.bge2bvlnqt4ei2oq3v9nr8a0lh9nkf6b4lh6c3j51k5kd67helmg`
is derived from the DNS Child Zone's name `example.co.uk` as described
in (#signalingnames).
The records are accompanied by RRSIG records created using the key(s)
of the respective Signaling Zone.

{#bootstrapping}
## Steps Taken by the Parental Agent

To complete the bootstrapping process, Parental Agents implementing
this protocol can act based upon a number of triggers (see
(#triggers)).
Once trigger conditions are fulfilled, the Parental Agent, knowing
both the Child zone name and its NS hostnames, MUST

1. verify that the Child is not currently securely delegated;

2. query the CDS/CDNSKEY records at the Child zone apex directly from
   each of the authoritative servers as listed in the NS record set;

3. query the CDS/CDNSKEY records located at each of the Signaling
   Names using a trusted validating DNS resolver;

4. check (separately by record type) that all record sets
   retrieved in Steps 2 and 3 have equal contents;

If the above steps succeeded without error, the Parental Agent MUST
construct a tentative DS record set either by copying the CDS record
contents or by computing DS records from the CDNSKEY record set, or
by doing both (i.e. amending the set of records copied from the CDS
record set).

The Parental Agent then MUST verify that for each signature algorithm
present, (at least) one of the keys referenced in the tentative DS
record set signs the Child's DNSKEY record set.
[ TODO Which other checks are needed to not break anything? ]

If this is the case, the Parental Agent SHOULD publish the DS record
set in the Parent zone, so as to secure the Child's delegation.

If, however, an error condition occurs, in particular:

- in Step 1: the Child is already securely delegated;

- in Step 2: any failure during the retrieval of the CDS/CDNSKEY
  records located at the Child apex from any of the authoritative
  nameservers, with an empty record set qualifying as a failure;

- in Step 3: DNS resolution failure during retrieval of CDS/CDNSKEY
  records from any Signaling Name, including failure of DNSSEC
  validation or unauthenticated data (AD bit not set);

- in Step 4: inconsistent responses;

- the tentative DS record set includes a signature algorithm without
  referencing a key of that algorithm which signs the Child's DNSKEY
  record set;

the Parental Agent MUST abort the procedure.

[ This level of rigor is needed for various reasons, including that
it prevents one operator from screwing up the zone in a multi-homed
setup (where several operators serve the same zone). ]

### Example

To bootstrap the Child zone `example.co.uk` using NS records
`ns1.example.net` and `ns2.example.net`, the Parental Agent

1. checks that the Child zone is not yet securely delegated;

2. queries CDS/CDNSKEY records for `example.co.uk` directly from
   `ns1.example.net` and `ns2.example.net`;

3. queries the CDS/CDNSKEY records located at the Signaling Names
   (see (#signalingnames))

```
example.bge2bvlnqt4ei2oq3v9nr8a0lh9nkf6b4lh6c3j51k5kd67helmg._boot.ns1.example.net
example.bge2bvlnqt4ei2oq3v9nr8a0lh9nkf6b4lh6c3j51k5kd67helmg._boot.ns2.example.net
```

4. checks that the CDS/CDNSKEY record sets retrieved in Steps 2
   and 3 agree across responses.

The Parental Agent then publishes a DS record set according to the
information retrieved in the previous steps.

## Opt-out

As a special case of Step 2 failure, the Child MAY opt out from DNSSEC
bootstrapping by publishing a CDS/CDNSKEY record with algorithm 0 and
other fields as specified in [@!RFC8078], Section 4, at its apex.

This mechanism is workable without regard to whether the Child zone's
signatures are managed by the Child DNS Operator or by the zone owner,
and without regard to what the Child DNS Operator decides to signal
under the Signaling Domain.


{#triggers}
## Triggers

[ Clarity of this section needs to be improved. ]

Parental Agents SHOULD trigger the procedure described in
(#bootstrapping) once one of the following conditions is fulfilled:

  - The Parental Agent receives a new or updated NS record set for a
    Child;

  - The Parental Agent encounters Signaling Records for its Children
    during a scan (e.g. daily) of known Signaling Domains (derived
    from the NS records used in its delegations).
  
    To perform such a scan, the Parental Agent iterates over some or
    all of its delegations and strips the first label off each one to
    construct the set of immediate ancestors of its children.  (For
    delegations one level below the Parent, such as second-level
    domain registrations, this will simply be the Parent's name.)
    The Parental Agent then uses these names to compute the second
    label of the Signaling Names.  The scan is completed by either

     * performing a targeted NSEC walk starting one level below the
       Signaling Domain, at the label that encodes the Child's
       ancestor; or

     * by performing a zone transfer of the zone containing the
       (relevant part of the) Signaling Domain, if the Signaling Zone
       operator allows it, and iterating over its contents.
    
    The Child's name is constructed by prepending the first label of
    the encountered Signaling Names to the ancestor from which the
    Signaling Name's second label was computed;

  - The Parental Agent performs an active (e.g. daily) scan by
    opportunistically querying the Signaling Records for some or all
    of its delegations;

  - Any other condition as deemed appropriate by local policy.

One of the inputs of the bootstrapping algorithm in (#bootstrapping)
is the NS record set of the Child's delegation.
It is therefore necessary to establish knowledge of the delegation's
NS record set before firing the trigger.

In some cases, the trigger context contains reliable information
about the Child's delegation, such as when bootstrapping is triggered
by the registrant changing their NS record set, or during a daily
scan of existing delegations.
In such cases, the delegation's NS records can be used directly.

In cases where the trigger context does not provide sufficient
knowledge of the NS record set, the Parental Agent MUST fetch the
delegation's NS record set and ensure that the proper NS record is
fed to the bootstrapping algorithm ((#bootstrapping)).

In particular, when discovering Signaling Names by means of an NSEC
walk or zone transfer, the Parental Agent MUST NOT assume that the
nameserver under whose domain the Signaling Names were discovered is
actually authoritative for the Child corresponding to the Signaling
Name encountered.
Before firing the trigger for a particular candidate Child, the
Parental Agent therefore MUST verify that the nameserver under whose
domain the scan occurred is contained of the Child delegation's NS
record set.


# Operational Recommendations

## Child DNS Operator

Signaling Domains SHOULD be delegated as zones of their own, so
that the Signaling Zone's apex coincides with the Signaling
Domain (such as `_boot.ns1.example.net`).
While it is permissible for the Signaling Domain to be contained
in a Signaling Zone of fewer labels (such as `example.net`), a
zone cut ensures that bootstrapping activities do not require
modifications of the zone containing the nameserver hostname.

In addition, Signaling Zones SHOULD use NSEC to allow consumers
to efficiently discover pending bootstrapping operations by means of
zone walking (see (#triggers)).  This is especially useful for bulk
processing after a Child DNS Operator has enabled the protocol.

To keep the size of the Signaling Zones minimal, Child DNS Operators
SHOULD remove Signaling Records which are found to have been acted
upon.  This is particularly important when the Child DNS Operator
allows Parental Agents to perform scans of the Signaling Zone, either
by allowing zone transfers or by permitting zone walks via NSEC, so
that bulk processing remains efficient.

## Parental Agent

It is RECOMMENDED to perform queries within Signaling Domains
((#bootstrapping)) with an (initially) cold resolver cache as to
retrieve the most current information regardless of TTL.
(When a batch job is used to attempt bootstrapping for a large number
of delegations, the cache does not need to get cleared in between.)

[It is expected that Signaling Records have few consumers only, so
that caching would not normally have a performance benefit. On the
other hand, perhaps it is better to RECOMMEND low TTLs instead?]


# Implementation Status

**Note to the RFC Editor**: please remove this entire section before publication.

## Child DNS Operator-side

* Knot DNS supports manual creation of non-apex CDS/CDNSKEY/DNSKEY records.

* PowerDNS supports manual creation of non-apex CDS/CDNSKEY/DNSKEY records.

* Proof-of-concept Signaling Domains with several thousand Signaling
  Names exist at `_boot.ns1.desec.io` and `_boot.ns2.desec.org`.
  Signaling Names can be discovered via NSEC walking.

* A tool to automatically generate signaling records for bootstrapping
  purposes is under development by the authors.

## Parental Agent-side

* A tool to retrieve and process Signaling Records for bootstrapping
  purposes, either directly or via zone walking, is available at
  <https://github.com/desec-io/dsbootstrap>.
  The tool implements outputs the validated DS records which then can
  be added to the parent zone.


# Security Considerations

Thoughts:

- We use at least one established chain of trust (via the secure delegations of
  the zones containing the NS hostnames).  As a result,
    * communication is authenticated;
    * process is immediate (no need for observing CDS/CDNSKEY records via TCP
      for several days);
    * an active on-wire attacker cannot tamper with the delegation.

- Security in view of [@!RFC8078]:
    * The security l of the method is strictly higher than the "accept
      CDS/CDNSKEY after a while"-approach that is already in use at several
      ccTLD registries ("Accept after Delay", [@!RFC8078], Section 3.3).
      This is because the method described here adds stronger guarantees,
      but removes nothing.
    * In case of a hash collision, two distinct child zones may be associated
      with the same signaling name.  However, key mix-up is prevented by the
      requirement to check signaling records against the "original copy" at
      the Child's apex.  A collision thus produces a mismatch and impede
      bootstrapping, but it won't allow an attacker to inject unauthorized
      key material.  The situation is thus equivalent to the traditional
      bootstrapping model (e.g. RFC 8078).  Other mitigations such as salt
      are thus not considered necessary.

- Actors in the chain(s) of trust of the zone(s) used for bootstrapping (the DNS
  Operator themselves, plus entities further up in the chain) can undermine the
  protocol.  However,
    * that's also possible in the case of CDS/CDNSKEY (see previous point);
    * if the Child DNS Operator doesn't control the zones in which its NS
      hostnames live (including their nameservers' A records) because the path
      from the root is untrusted, you probably don't want to trust that operator
      as a whole;
    * when bootstrapping is done upon receipt of a new NS record set, the
      window of opportunity is very small;
    * mitigation exists by diversifying e.g. the nameserver hostname's TLDs,
      which is advisable anyways;
    * correct bootstrapping is easily monitored by the Child DNS operator.

# Possible Extensions

The mechanism described in (#signalingnames) provides a public,
authenticated, in-band, unidirectional channel through which the
Child DNS Operator can publish information on the zones it serves.

By provisioning other types of Signaling Records, the Child DNS
Operator can therefore convey signals that pertain to use cases other
than bootstrapping a DNSSEC delegation.

## Multi-Signer Setups: Onboarding a Signing Party

[@!RFC8901] describes multi-signer models in which several Child DNS
Operators serve the same Child zone.  In one of these scenarios
(Model 2, [@!RFC8901], Section 2.1.2), each Child DNS Operator holds
a unique KSK set and ZSK set to sign the zone.

To ensure smooth resolution of Child zone queries, this scheme
demands that participating Child DNS Operators import the ZSK sets
of the other providers into their DNSKEY RRset.  Further, each
operator's KSK(s) need to be included in the DS record set at the
delegation point in the Parent zone.
When a new Child DNS Operator is joining the scheme, these
synchronization processes have to occur before the new operator's
nameserver hostnames are included in the Child's NS record set.

So far, it has been assumed that the KSK and ZSK extraction and
provisioning would happen through some proprietary API at each
DNS operator ([@!RFC8901], Section 9).
We now describe how a Child DNS Operator can instead use Signaling
Records to make its own set of DNSKEY records available for querying
by other signing parties, so that they can retrieve, validate, and
process them.

### Signaling Records

Given a Child zone `example.co.uk` that is already securely delegated
with authoritative nameservers `ns1.example.net` and `ns2.example.net`,
we consider how a new Child DNS Operator using nameservers
`ns3.example.org` and `ns4.example.org` can distribute its DNSKEY
record set to the existing signing parties, in order to join the
multi-signer group.

The Signaling Domains corresponding to the new Child DNS Operator's
nameservers are `_boot.ns3.example.org` and `_boot.ns4.example.org`.

In the zones containing these domains, the new Child DNS Operator
publishes a DNSKEY record set containing the keys used by the
operator when operating the Child zone, at the Signaling Names
```
example.bge2bvlnqt4ei2oq3v9nr8a0lh9nkf6b4lh6c3j51k5kd67helmg._boot.ns3.example.org
example.bge2bvlnqt4ei2oq3v9nr8a0lh9nkf6b4lh6c3j51k5kd67helmg._boot.ns4.example.org
```
where the first label is calculated as described in
(#signalingnames).  The records are accompanied by RRSIG records
created using the key(s) of the respective Signaling Zone.

Note that DNSKEY records are not restricted to apex owner names
([@!RFC4035], Section 2.1).  However, only apex DNSKEY records are
used for DNSSEC validation ([@!RFC4035], Section 5).  As Signaling
Names do not occur on zone cuts (see (#signalingrecords)), the use
of DNSKEY records described here does not interfere with existing
DNSKEY uses.

### Import

With the Signaling Records in place, an algorithm similar to the one
given in (#bootstrapping) can be used to query and validate the
joining operator's DNSKEY set.  The required steps can either be
taken autonomously by each participating operator (query, validate,
update local zone copy with imported information), or be subject to
central coordination using "Multisigner Controller" tooling which
interfaces with each operator.

The new KSKs can then be added to the delegation's DS record set as
described in [@!RFC8901], Section 8 (i.e. via an [@!RFC7344] rollover
using CDS/CDNSKEY records), followed by the inclusion of the new ZSKs
in the other operators' DNSKEY record sets.
Similarly, the new operator can import the other operators' DNSKEYs
into its local copy of the Child zone (either autonomously, or via
central coordination).

[ Note that the DNSKEY record set in the Child zone contains keys
from all operators, whereas the DNSKEY record set published under the
Signaling Domain is restricted to keys actively used by the
publishing operator. ]

After convergence on the served DNSKEY record sets has been achieved,
the joining process is completed by amending the Child's NS record
set to include the new operator's authoritative nameservers, followed
by a corresponding update of the NS delegation records at the Parent
(e.g. using CSYNC [@!RFC7477]).
