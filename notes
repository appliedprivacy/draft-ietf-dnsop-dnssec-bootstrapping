Todos:
- emphasize benefit for Managed DNS Providers
	* Brian: I wasn't initially thinking that is a good idea, because it wasn't highlighted
	  that this is meant primarily for managed DNS providers hosting registrant's domains
	  (e.g. hinted at in the name of the draft, or in the mailing list posting).
	* add "Automatic"? / RFC 7344: Automating DNSSEC Delegation Trust Maintenance
- not really for bootstrapping a new child, but for onboarding a Child DNS Operator as a new delegated signe
- require validation of empty CDS/CDNSKEY record set at the Child apex using bootstrapping keys?
	* no, could be opt-out because the owner can't get the signatures correct. But one could try that and log an error.
- opt-out via CDNSKEY 0 3 0 0?

Multi-signer:
- There may be a contradiction of goals when the new operator is in bailiwick (as other providers show up further up in the chain, somehow vouching for each other etc.).
- However, this can only happen in multi-signer setups. (In a single-signer setup, when doing in-bailiwick bootstrapping, the chain-of-trust precondition is not fulfilled.)
- Prohibit in-bailiwick? (perhaps possible later using CSYNC?)
